# SerialKillers
Cleaning the data and analysis of serial killers dataset downloaded from Kaggle website.

Due to the high peak of interest in true-crime TV series, I thought it would be interesting to look at the fundamental data we have about these horrific individuals. 

Because it is my first self-made project, I wanted the dataset to be complicated enough but not too extensive to be able to trace my code and results quickly and efficiently. 

The dataset contains 305 records of every known serial killer including their name, country and years concerning their activity, proven victims, possible victims and notes.

My main goal for this project is to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis using Python. 

Then, I hope to be able to get some insightful info about serial killers by analysing the data and visualizing it using Python and PowerBI.
